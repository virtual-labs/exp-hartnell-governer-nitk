#### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator

1. The simulation window shows front, top view and free-body diagram of the Hartnell governor.<br>

2. Speed control and mass control slider is given in variables tab, in the controls tab two checkboxes are given for displaying free-body diagram at **Minimum Position** and **Maximum Position** and a button called **Go to Experiment** opens the experiment page.<br>

3. Moving the slider knob to the right, changes the rotational speed from 365 to 400 rpm. Moving the slider knob to the right, changes the mass from 1 to 6 kg.<br>

4. When **Maximum Position** checkbox is checked, a free body diagram of the maximum position will appear on the simulation screen. <br>

5. For the experiments select **Go to Experiment** in the control panel <br>

6. On the experiment page of the simulator, the user can choose between calculating and identifying the parts of the hartnell governor. The control panel can be used to start the experiment or to go back to the simulator.<br>

7. In the calculation experiment, constant variables, minimum and maximum position free body diagram (can be selected from the control tab) is given for the calculation of the stiffness of spring, radius of rotation, and lift of sleeve. User can verify the calculation in the check box. User can use the **Reset Experiment** in the control panel to reset the experiment for new calculation. For going back to choose the experiment **Exit Experiment** button can be used in control panel.<br>

8. In the identify parts of the governor experiment, a Hartnell governor setup in the middle of the simulation screen, different parts of the governor have the dropdown box where user can choose the part name and verify the same.<br>
